# 🖐️ Hand Detection using OpenCV & MediaPipe

A real-time hand detection system built using Python.  
This project was part of my learning journey to understand computer vision concepts like webcam integration, hand landmark detection, and real-time drawing using OpenCV and MediaPipe.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple Python application that captures video from your webcam and uses MediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time.  
The program draws hand landmarks and connections on the video feed and displays messages depending on whether a hand is detected or not.

## 🆕 What's New in v1

- Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe  
- Flipped webcam display for a more natural view  
- Colored hand landmark and connection drawings  
- On-screen text messages indicating detection status  
- User instruction to press `Esc` key to exit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ✅ Python 3.x  
- ✅ OpenCV (cv2)  
- ✅ MediaPipe  
- ✅ Webcam video streaming  
- ✅ DrawingUtils for rendering hand skeleton  
- ✅ Basic terminal and visual debugging

## ⚠️ Python Version Compatibility

> 📌 Important Note:
This project works best with Python versions 3.7 to 3.10.
MediaPipe is not fully compatible with Python 3.11 or above, and you might get errors when trying to run the program.

📝 Please make sure your Python version is 3.10 or lower for this code to work properly.
